# Angular2-Interpolation
Interpolation is one-way data binding technique from angular 2. With interpolation, we place the component property name in the view template, enclosed in double curly braces. ex. {{propertyName}}
In this example, Angular pulls the value of the appTitle property from the component and inserts it between the opening and closing '<h1>' element.
